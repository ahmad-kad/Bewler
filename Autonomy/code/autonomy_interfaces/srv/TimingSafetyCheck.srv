# Timing Safety Check Service
# Monitors timing constraints and deadlines for safety-critical operations

# Request
bool real_time_check        # Check real-time performance
float64 time_window         # Time window to analyze (seconds)
string[] monitored_components # Specific components to check timing for

---
# Response
bool timing_safe            # Overall timing safety status
string timing_status        # "NOMINAL", "WARNING", "CRITICAL", "FAILED"

# Timing metrics
float64 avg_response_time   # Average response time (ms)
float64 max_response_time   # Maximum response time (ms)
float64 min_response_time   # Minimum response time (ms)
float64 jitter              # Response time jitter (ms)
int32 deadline_misses       # Number of deadline misses in time window
float64 deadline_miss_rate  # Rate of deadline misses (per second)

# Component timing
string[] components_checked # Components that were checked
float64[] component_avg_times # Average response times per component
int32[] component_deadlines_missed # Deadline misses per component

# System health
float64 cpu_utilization     # Current CPU utilization (0.0-1.0)
float64 memory_utilization  # Current memory utilization (0.0-1.0)
int32 thread_count          # Current number of active threads
bool real_time_scheduling   # Whether real-time scheduling is active

# Recommendations
string[] timing_recommendations # Actions to improve timing if needed
string timestamp            # When check was performed
